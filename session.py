#First Program
# Calculate Area of a Circle
# A=Ï€r2
#Area of circle = pie*radius**2

#pie = 3.1415
#diam = 14
#radi = diam/2

#input pie value
#input radius vzlue
#calculate area by:
#pir times r square
#display area of circle

#input miles value
#input name of the user
#convert kms to miles by:
#miles is 1.6*kms
#display kms with names

# write a program to input age of a user and let them know if they have a dibetese risk
# risk or not. Use case is that a user with are more than 65 is risky else not
# risky 
age = 55
if age >= 65 
 print("This is Risky")
else 
print ("not risky")

# write a program to calculate the GST tax of two products, apple and pie
# apple has 10% GST and pie has only 8%
# calculate total GST that need to be dedicated from the bill
# apple gross sales is $75, pie gross sale is $100
